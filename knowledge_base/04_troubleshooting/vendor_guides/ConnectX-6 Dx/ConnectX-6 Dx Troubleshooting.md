Event message received of insufficient power

When [ adapter's current power consumption ] > [ PCIe slot advertised power limit ] – a warning message appears in the server's system even logs (Eg. dmesg: "Detected insufficient power on the PCIe slow")It's recommended to use a PCIe slot that can supply enough power.If a message of the following format appears – "mlx5_core 0003:01:00.0: port_module:254:(pid 0): Port module event[error]: module 0, Cable error, One or more network ports have been powered down due to insufficient/unadvertised power on the PCIe slot" please upgrade your Adapter's firmware.If the message remains – please consider switching from Active Optical Cable (AOC) or transceiver to Direct Attached Copper (DAC) connectivity.
